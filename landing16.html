<p> The fourth industrial revolution is this evolving aspect in industry moving towards automation (TWI, No date). By using technologies including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and analytics and AI (Rthiraj, 2020). Manufacturers are continuing to evolve to improve their systems. The fourth industrial revolution this has opened up to new risks that previously were not there. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) discuss the 6 types of risk: technical, competence, acceptance by staff, acceptance by customers, and partners, data privacy and security and financial risks. Highest effect of risk was found in customer channels and revenue stream. Customer channels is the relationship between main criteria and other less specific areas (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019). One example of Industry 4.0 is cloud computing. Cloud computing is a model for a network to access shared pools of resources (Paul & Ghose, 2012). This can be used on demand with minimal management. Data and analytics are when data is analysed and thus interpreted. By interpreting past data, future markets can be better understood (MBN, 2022). Data security risk is one of the most growing areas of risk in industry 4.0. Data security is how most industries protect digital information from attackers. This can be done via data masking, data erasure, encryption, and data resiliency (IBM, No date). Behavioural risk is due to poor workforce understanding on risk and thus make mistakes leading to data breaches (PwC, No date). Organizations need to ensure they provide adequate training and monitor this with reports, testing, interviews, surveys and observations to ensure behavioural risk is low. Although Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) article had limitations there is an overall consensus about the type of risks found in industrial 4.0 and how to go about assessing, evaluating and protecting against them (Lezzi, Lazoi & Corallo, 2018 & Radanliev et al., 2020).</p>

<p>The authors refer to the digitization of manufacturing as "industry 4.0," which includes adopting computers and automation as well as enhancing it with intelligent, autonomous systems that are powered by data and machine learning. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>One of the example in the real world is the Amazon delivery robot called 'Amazon Scout'. This is to automate the deliveries without a human driver. (itv.com, 2021). This keeps the business operation running during the resource shortage in pandemics. However, it also comes with risks like loss of robot with parcel during delivery. The robot cannot protect itseld someone could stole it together with parcel. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The other example is resturant robot waiter. The use case is also to resolve the resource shortage and automate for the dishes serve (theguardian.com, 2022). It also comes with risk when the control management system was down or malfunction. The robot could not serve customers or serve dishes wrongly. Then, it has to turn back to people serving. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The other article supporting the points is a whitepaper from Deloitte. It points out applying Industry 4.0 to build revenue and using Industry 4.0 technologies to increase productivity and reduce risk. Most of business especially SME has to increase productivity and build revenue. Effective use of information can in turn impact key business objectives such as business growth and business operations (Brenna S. Monika M. & Mark J., N.D.). </p>

<p>Thank you for your interesting post Kwok. When considering robots and automation in future roles which were previously human roles there are many aspects that need to be considered. Productivity will definitely be increased but other important aspects may be lost. Most of us still need some human level of interaction in our lives. Robots do not have the level of psychology support needed for a sustained relationship (Unesco, No date). Robots need to understand cultural and social norms. This may develop but I do feel it will take time to be a key integral part of our community. Some countries are further ahead and implementing robots into helping daily life. An example of this is Japan. Japan has one of the oldest populations in the world and do not have enough carers and support for this age group. Japan is leading in this area of expertise and many countries may have to follow with a growing aging population (Stanford, No date). </p>

<p>Risks of Digitalisation of Business Models – A Collaborative Discussion</p>
<p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), also known as Industry 4.0, refers to the marriage of physical assets and advanced digital technologies – the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robots, drones, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, cloud computing, nanotechnology, and more – that communicate, analyse, and act upon information, enabling organisations, consumers, and society to be more flexible and responsive and make more intelligent, data-driven decisions. (Deloitte Insights, 2020) </p>
<p>As the world today accelerates towards the adoption of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies, with emerging technologies at our disposal such as cloud computing, automation, Internet of things (IoT), big data, advanced data analytics, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned vehicles (UV), augmented reality, and 3D printing to name a few. </p>
<p>These technologies have changed our everyday lives and subsequently lead small, medium, and big corporates to transform their business models. For example, The Internet of and for things will allow us to connect almost anything to the internet with the use of sensors, everything will be smart, enabling greater communication and data-driven services based on increased analytics capabilities. Another example is Big Data Automation and Analytics technology, which will help organisations in analysing a large volume of data and having automated decision-making to provide quicker and real-time services. the This puts the article by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) in context when referring to Industry 4.0. </p>
<p>Given the advanced technologies presented by Industry 4.0, it is imminent that the risk universe will expand significantly in reflection of the 4IR advancements. </p>
<p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) have created and introduced 6 types of risks RADi (Risk assessment for Digitalisation) to be used when planning and implementing Industry 4.0 pillars into existing or new business models. These categories mainly consist of technical risks, competence risks, internal behavioural risks (related to staff skills and attitudes), external behavioural risks (related to customers’ and partners’ attitudes and changes), data security risks, and financial risks. </p>
<p>Some of the Risks that can be realised competence risks leading to job losses for unskilled labour as these technologies will render some jobs obsolete due to automated processes and can also in turn introduce new jobs that never existed before and will not require human intervention, another risk which can be categorised under data security risks will be that of privacy encompassing the handling and access to private information and the authenticity and trusting of the huge amount of information available. </p>
<p>Schwab (2016) emphasises similar sentiments as Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) and highlights matching technologies and risks associated with Industry 4.0. </p>
<p>Schwab (2016) further states that: </p>
<p>Today we find ourselves at the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution,   the world is fast changing, hyper-connected, ever more complex and becoming more fragmented but we can still shape our future in a way that benefits all…The fourth industrial revolution has the potential to robotize humanity, and thus compromise our traditional sources of meaning - work, community, family, identity. </p>

<p>Re: Initial Post by Pearce Begley - Saturday, 5 November 2022, 12:17 PM</p>
<p>I think you make some really interesting points Nkosana. You found some great research on 4IR and what the future may hold. I had not thought about the changes in our traditions with work and community, but this is a compelling issue that does need to be considered. We also need to consider how marginalised communities may feel about 4IR and the risk that it may bring larger inequalities around the world due to socioeconomic growth (Aziz, 2019). It has also impacted small medium-sized enterprises (SME's). 4IR has grown at an alarming rate SME's have struggled to keep up (Aziz, 2019). The number of SME's are falling and thus this affects community and their identity as you mentioned by Nkosana above. 50% of companies in 2022 believe automation will reduce the number of full-time staff they have by 2030. When considering this across the world this could affect up to 800 million workers. This is becoming increasingly more alarming for the average person who has to support their family and could lead to a crisis in future years. Jobs that will most likely be affected a lower skilled job including food preparation. Governments need to be thinking about workforce and their population now and create new training and job avenues for people to explore (Change, 2022). </p>
