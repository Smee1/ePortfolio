										<h2>Pure Telecom Limited</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We received a complaint in March 2013 from an individual who received two marketing phone calls from Pure Telecom Limited on his landline telephone. The individual’s telephone number was listed on the National Directory Database opt-out register. It is an offence to make a marketing call to a telephone number listed on that register. </p>
<p>Pure Telecom Limited informed our investigators that it used the services of a third-party representative to make the marketing calls and it explained that the agent sourced the individual’s number themselves rather than using marketing data provided by Pure Telecom Limited. The company admitted that the third-party agent did not have consent to contact the complainant for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>At Dublin District Court on 3 February 2014, Pure Telecom Limited pleaded guilty to two charges concerning breaches of Regulation 13 (5)(b) of S.I. 336 of 2011 relating to two marketing phone calls to a phone number listed on the opt-out register. The Court imposed a conviction in respect of both charges and a fine of €500. It further ordered payment of the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner. The hearing was informed that the defendant had a previous conviction from 2010 for a similar offence. 
</p>

										<h2>Next Retail Limited</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In February 2013, this Office received a complaint from an individual who received a number of unsolicited marketing emails from Next Retail Limited after she requested the company not to send her any more such emails. The complainant claimed to have unsubscribed firstly by using the unsubscribe link that was provided in a marketing email sent by the company and, following this, in four separate emails to the company requesting not to be contacted with marketing emails again. </p>
<p>Next Retail Limited informed our investigators that as it no longer used the services of the company that it had engaged to process unsubscriptions it was unable to explain what happened to the first unsubscribe request. With regard to the emails containing unsubscribe requests, the company confirmed that they did reach its complaints inbox but it was unable to trace where the emails went afterwards. </p>
<p>At Dublin District Court on 3 February 2014, Next Retail Limited pleaded guilty to two charges concerning breaches of Regulation 13(1) of S.I. 336 of 2011 relating to the sending of two unsolicited marketing emails without consent. The Court imposed a conviction in respect of one charge, with the second charge taken into consideration. A fine of €100 was imposed. The defendant agreed to cover the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner. </p>
<p>Next Retail Limited subsequently appealed the severity of the sentence. On 19 March 2014, the Circuit Court affirmed the conviction and penalty previously imposed by the District Court and it noted the appellant’s intention to discharge the Data Protection Commissioner’s reasonable costs for the appeal.

										<h2>Airtricity Limited</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In May 2013, this Office received a complaint against Airtricity Limited from a person who received an unsolicited marketing phone call on his landline telephone, which was listed on the National Directory Database opt-out register. The complainant informed us that the purpose of the marketing call was to encourage him to switch energy supplier to Airtricity. </p>
<p>In response to our investigation, Airtricity admitted that the phone call had been made by a third-party contractor acting on its behalf. It explained that the error occurred when an old PC, on which the 2009 phone book was installed, was re-commissioned by the contractor. A spreadsheet containing the complainant’s phone number was still on the old PC and this led to the number being dialled in error. </p>
<p>At Dublin District Court on 3 February 2014, Airtricity Limited pleaded guilty to one charge concerning a breach of Regulation 13(5)(b) of S.I. 336 of 2011 relating to one marketing phone call to a phone number listed on the opt-out register. The Court imposed a conviction in respect of the charge and a fine of €75. The defendant agreed to cover the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner.

										<h2>The Carphone Warehouse Limited</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In March 2013, we received a complaint from a customer of The Carphone Warehouse Limited after he received marketing text messages from the company despite having ticked the marketing opt-out box when he had previously made a purchase in one of its stores. The company informed our investigators that a systems error resulted in the customer being incorrectly included in its marketing list. </p>
<p>In April 2013, we received a complaint from another customer of The Carphone Warehouse Limited who received regular offers by text message from the company even though he had called the company on at least three occasions, asking that it stop. The company told our investigators that its system temporarily did not recognise the customer’s preference not to receive marketing due to an internal issue within the electronic filter process and this resulted in the customer’s phone number being accidentally selected for marketing campaigns. </p>
<p>At Dublin District Court on 3 March 2014, The Carphone Warehouse Limited entered a guilty plea in respect of five charges concerning breaches of Regulations 13(1) and 13(4) of S.I. 336 of 2011. The court imposed convictions in respect of four charges, with the fifth charge taken into consideration. It imposed fines of €1,500 in respect of each conviction. The defendant agreed to cover the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner. The hearing was informed that the defendant had two previous convictions from 2012 in relation to the sending of unsolicited marketing emails.

										<h2>Valterous Limited (trading as Therapie Clinic and/or Therapie) </h2>
									</header>
									<p>A former customer of Valterous Limited (trading as Therapie Clinic and/or Therapie) complained to this Office in June 2013 after receiving an unsolicited marketing text message despite having opted out of receiving such communications over three months earlier. Therapie explained to our investigators that the complainant’s contact details were on systems in two branches and that when the opt-out request was made the company removed their details from one database and did not realise they were also on another one, thus leading to a further unsolicited text message being sent to the same contact number. </p>
<p>In July 2013, we received a complaint from another former customer of Therapie who had received marketing text messages on several occasions. The complainant informed us that she sent a text message to opt out but the company continued to send her further marketing text messages. Our investigation found no evidence that Therapie had obtained consent at any time for the sending of marketing text messages to this individual. In relation to the sending of text messages after the former customer had opted out, Therapie explained that the individual should have texted the word “STOP” rather than the word “OPTOUT” at the time of attempting to opt out of the marketing database. We did not accept this as a valid excuse as the opt-out instruction on the marketing text message sent to the individual read “OptOut:086.......”. </p>
<p>At Dublin District Court on 3 March 2014, Valterous Limited (trading as Therapie Clinic and/or Therapie) pleaded guilty in relation to three charges concerning breaches of Regulation 13(1) of S.I. 336 of 2011 concerning the sending of unsolicited marketing text messages without consent. The Court imposed convictions in respect of two charges, with the third charge taken into consideration. It imposed fines of €1,500 in respect of each conviction. The defendant agreed to pay the prosecution costs of the Data Protection Commissioner. The Court was told that in 2012 Therapie Laser Clinics Limited (trading as Therapie Clinic and/or Therapie) was convicted for two offences in relation to the sending of unsolicited marketing text messages.
